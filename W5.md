Weekly Quiz 5
========================================================

### Question 1

Load the weaving data with the commands:

```
data(warpbreaks)
```

Fit an ANOVA model where the outcome is the number of breaks. Fit an ANOVA model including the wool and tension variables as covariates. What are the dgrees of freedom for the tension variable and what is the F-statistic for tension after accounting for the variation due to wool?

1. The degrees of freedom for tension is 2 and the F-statistic is 7.537.  ✔
2. The degrees of freedom for tension is 1 and the F-statistic is 3.339.
3. The degrees of freedom for tension is 50 and the F-statistic is 135.
4. The degrees of freedom for tension is 2 and the F-statistic is 7.206. 


```r
data(warpbreaks)
aovObject <- aov(warpbreaks$breaks ~ warpbreaks$wool + warpbreaks$tension)

data(crabs)
plot(crabs$Width, crabs$Satellites, pch = 19, col = "grey", xlab = "Width of the famale in centimeters", 
    ylab = "Number of male partners")
glm1 <- glm(crabs$Satellites ~ crabs$Width, family = "poisson")
points(crabs$Width, glm1$fitted, col = "red", lwd = 3, pch = 19)
